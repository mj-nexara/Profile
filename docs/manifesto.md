# üìú Nexara Ethical Manifesto

> ‚ÄúWe do not seek power. We seek incorruptible coordination.‚Äù

## Purpose

To establish a decentralized, transparent, and ethical governance protocol that protects dignity, verifies actions, and empowers citizens without coercion.

## Core Principles

1. Dignity before design  
2. Transparency before control  
3. Consent over coercion  
4. Permanence over manipulation  
5. Participation over permission

## Moral Anchors

- Every proposal must be signed.  
- Every vote must be visible.  
- Every decision must be reversible with consent.

This manifesto serves as the moral root of all Nexara infrastructure.  
Its original version is pinned via IPFS and ratified by the Guardian Circle.
